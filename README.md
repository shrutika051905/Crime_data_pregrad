b. If additional data is required, collect it from reliable sources and mention the source.
3. Implementation Guidelines:
a. Use Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
b. Visualize results using appropriate graphs (matplotlib/seaborn).
c. Write SQL queries to retrieve answers and display the output.
d. Provide observations under each Jupyter Notebook cell.
4. Coding Standards:
a. Add comments for every line of code. (use Codeium/Blackbox for it).
b. Maintain clean and readable code with structured explanations.
c. Solve every question with two approaches:
i. SQL queries and
ii. Pandas
iii. Use the output from Pandas and create an appropriate graph for the results.
5. Submission Format:

Crime Data Analysis Assignment
Questions:
1. Annual Crime Trends: Compute the total number of victims per year and analyze any patterns or fluctuations in crime rates over the years.
2. State-Wise Crime Analysis (2001-2012): Perform a comprehensive analysis of various crimes recorded in each state over the given period. Identify trends, anomalies, and patterns.
3. City-Wise Crime Distribution: For each state, identify the top six cities with the highest recorded crime incidents.
4. Highest Crime Rate States: Determine the top five states with the highest crime rates across all crime categories.
5. Crimes Against Women: Identify the top five cities with the highest number of crimes committed against women.
6. Reasons Behind Violent Crimes: Using the dataset, analyze the primary reasons associated with incidents of kidnapping and murder.
7. Crime Pair Analysis: Identify the top ten pairs of crimes where one crime tends to lead to another (e.g., kidnapping leading to murder, custodial torture leading to custodial death, rape leading to murder, etc.).
8. Safest States for Women: Determine the top five states that are statistically the safest for women, based on crime rates related to women’s safety.
9. Safest Cities for Women: Identify the top five cities with the lowest crime rates against women.
10. Profile of Rape Offenders: Categorize and rank the top three relationships between rape offenders and their victims based on recorded data.
11. Socioeconomic Factors and Crime:
a. Analyze whether there is a correlation between a person’s salary and their likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.
b. Examine how literacy rates influence the likelihood of an individual being involved in crimes.
12. Juvenile Crime Analysis:
a. Identify the top three reasons at the state level for juveniles (individuals under 18 years of age) being involved in crimes.
b. Determine the top ten states with the highest number of juvenile crime cases.
13. Crime Rate Trends Over Time: Calculate the rate of change in total crimes for each state over the given timeline and identify states with significant increases or decreases.
14. Crime Distribution by State: Compute and visualize the percentage share of each type of crime for all states to understand the distribution of criminal activities.
